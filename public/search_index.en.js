Theorem, also known as Hall's Marriage Theorem, can be used to decide\nwhether or not a perfect matching exists in a bipartite graph. This can be \napplied to solving constraint satisfaction problems where some members of a set X \nneed to be matched with members of a set Y, but these members can only be matched\n1-to-1.\nThe advantage of Hall's Theorem is that it allows us to use set logic to determine\nwhether or not a matching exists for some constraint satisfaction problem.\nTypically, we would need to use a flow network to compute the maximal matching, or any matching, of a given graph. When applying Hall's Theorem, we don't need to construct a flow network or apply a max flow algorithm. We can instead\nmatch members of the powerset of X to some selection of Y by only looking at the\nset of neighbors that each vertex in X has.\nIf you're going to be working with Hall's Theorem, it would be good to\nfamiliarize yourself with set union, set intersection, and the identities\nrelated to the cardinality of a set. One helpful identity has been included\nbelow.\n\n\\(|A \\cup B| + |A \\cap B| = |A| + |B|\\)\n\nTheorem\nFor a bipartite graph G on the parts X and Y, the following conditions are\nequivalent.\n\n(a) There is a perfect matching of X into Y.\n(b) For each \\(T \\subseteq X \\), the inequality \\(|T| \\leq |N_g(T)| \\) holds.\n\nDefinitions\nLet G be a simple graph, and let S be a subset of the edges of G. If no two\nedges in S form a path (i.e., if no two edges share a vertex), then we can say\nthat S is a matching of G. A matching S of G is a perfect matching if\nevery vertex of G participates in some edge of S.\nLet G be a bipartite graph. The vertices of G can be partitioned into the parts\nX and Y, s.t. no two vertices of X share an edge in G and no two vertices in Y\nshare an edge in G. Let S be a matching of G. If every vertex in X participates\nin an edge of S, then we can say that S is a perfect matching of X into Y.\nFor a graph G and some subset T of the vertices of G, we can define the function\n\\(N_g(T)\\) as the set of vertices of G that share an edge with the vertices of\nT. If G is a bipartite with parts X and Y and T is some set of vertices of X,\nthen \\(N_g(T)\\) is some set of vertices of Y (i.e., it is the set of\ncandidates that can be matched to the members of T).\n\\[N_g(T) = \\text{ \\{ } v \\in V(G) \\text{ | } vw \\in E(G) \\text{ for some } w \\in T \\text{ \\} } \\]\n","id":"https://latenitecoding.github.io/halls-theorem/","title":"Hall's Theorem"},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://latenitecoding.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/theorems/":{"body":"","id":"https://latenitecoding.github.io/theorems/","title":"Theorems"}},"docInfo":{"https://latenitecoding.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/_algorithms/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/_contests/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/_data_structures/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/_exercises/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/_theorems/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/about/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/algorithms/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/contests/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/data-structures/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/exercises/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/halls-theorem/":{"body":243,"title":2},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://latenitecoding.github.io/theorems/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":15},"lang":"English"};
